## Overview:
Deeper dive into swift in some advanced topic. All are from https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/....

### ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) | strong/week/unowned References:
To make sure that instances don’t disappear while they’re still needed, ARC tracks how many properties, constants, and variables are currently referring to each class instance. ARC will not de-allocate an instance as long as at least one active reference to that instance still exists.

To make this possible, whenever you assign a class instance to a property, constant, or variable, that property, constant, or variable makes a strong reference to the instance. The reference is called a “strong” reference because it keeps a firm hold on that instance, and doesn’t allow it to be de-allocated for as long as that strong reference remains

* Strong Refs:
Strong Ref can sometimes create memory leak by not allowing ARC to de-allocate. In the example below, making the instance nil do not de-allocate the instance memory because there are still strong reference between them through tenant and apartment
```swift
class Person {
    let name: String
    init(name: String) { self.name = name }
    var apartment: Apartment?
    deinit { print("\(name) is being deinitialized") }
}

class Apartment {
    let unit: String
    init(unit: String) { self.unit = unit }
    var tenant: Person?
    deinit { print("Apartment \(unit) is being deinitialized") }
}

var john: Person?
var unit4A: Apartment?

john = Person(name: "John Appleseed")
unit4A = Apartment(unit: "4A")

john!.apartment = unit4A
unit4A!.tenant = john

// making both nil will not de-allocated the memory by ARC, because there are still strong reference between them through tenant and apartment property
john = nil
unit4A = nil
```
* strong to weak conversion:

* unowned reference:

### Closure Invocation:
It's same as function invoker
```swift
let abc = {print("hi")}
abc() // "hi"
```

### Swift Singleton:
```swift
class Singleton3 {
    let count = 1;
    static let sharedInstance: Singleton3 = {
        let instance: Singleton3 = Singleton3();
        return instance
    }(); // needs to be invoked with `()` as property cannot be left nil
    
    init () {
        print("print first time only")
    }
}

let first = Singleton3.sharedInstance
let second = Singleton3.sharedInstance // calling again will not trigger the init block again.
```

### Strong & Weak References (Extra info):
- A `strong` reference means that an object will not be de-allocated as long as at least one strong reference to it exists.
- A `weak` reference, on the other hand, doesn’t prevent an object from being de-allocated. When an object has only weak references, it’ll be de-allocated....

```swift
class Child {
  var name: String
  weak var parent: Parent? // weak reference
  init(name: String, parent: Parent) {
    self.name = name
    self.parent = parent
  }
  deinit {
    print("Child \(name) is being de-initialized")
  }
}

class Parent {
  var name: String
  var children: [Child] = []
  init(name: String) {
    self.name = name
  }
  func addChild(name: String) {
    let child = Child(name: name, parent: self)
    children.append(child)
  }
  deinit {
    print("Parent \(name) is being de-initialized")
  }
}

var parent: Parent? = Parent(name: "Sandy")
parent!.addChild(name: "Patrick")
parent!.addChild(name: "Emily")
parent!.addChild(name: "Joanna")
parent = nil

//         Parent Sandy is being de-initialized
//         Child Patrick is being de-initialized
//         Child Emily is being de-initialized
//         Child Joanna is being de-initialized
```

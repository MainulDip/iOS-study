### Setup Instructions:
Instade of running swift from xcode or playgrounds, swift runtime is used on both mac and windows. On windows it is made possible by (Swift Fro Windows)[https://swiftforwindows.github.io/] and with some vs code extension. But the IDE features (intellisense) is somewhat limited on windows version of vs code. As swift become open source recently, we may see some more development in swift on other operating systems in future ..............

### Swift-UI intro: 
It's a declarative layout system based on VHZ (Vertical/Y, Horizontal/X, Depth/z) stack. It's inspired form the web design world. Focus on cross-platform apple ecosystem app.
* live preview canvas and drag and drop views on the preview/canvas  area. When dropped, the ui code will be generated by xcode.
* Provide easy code (modular) reusability. cmd + click any stack and select the "extract into sub-view". It will create a struct an call that from the main view. Params can be supplied same way as struct constructor.
* Project Catalyst : convert ios app into mac app (simply checking the mac checkbox on root project config)
* Initially provides 2 structs, 1 for the actual content (ContentView) and other is for the preview/canvas area as Content_Previews
* Device/Canvas Preview frame can be changed in the previews function by using => ContentView().previewDevice(PreviewDevice(rawValue: "iPhone SE"))

### Basic Project Structures
* Directory:
    - ProjectName : Source file for the App
    - ProjectNameTests : Unit Tests
    - ProjectNameUITests : UI Tests
    - Products : 

* Source Directory :
    - <projectname>app.swift : Entry point, @main
    - <anything>view.swift : View File, consumed by @main
    - info.plist : project configuration file
    - Assets.xcassets : Asset files (images, icons, etc) 
    - Preview Content : Generated by xcode for app's preview
### Login-Intro App Docs:
- String to Binding<String> : $string
- @State : @ is attribute in swift
- some : It is used together with a protocol to create an opaque type that represents something that is conformed to a specific protocol. 

```swift
// The following 3 function signatures are identical.

func wash<T: Vehicle>(_ vehicle: T) {
    // Wash the given vehicle
}

func wash<T>(_ vehicle: T) where T: Vehicle {
    // Wash the given vehicle
}

func wash(_ vehicle: some Vehicle)  {
    // Wash the given vehicle
}
```
- CGFloat : NSObject version of a floating point num

### SwiftUI Basics:
- Starting Point: <ProjectName>App.swift is the starting point which is denoted by @main attribute before the struct name. The struct inherit App protocol.
```swift
import SwiftUI

var isUserLoggedIn : Bool = true;

@main // starting point
struct LoginIntroApp: App { // inherit App protocol
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            if isUserLoggedIn {
                MainView()
            } else {
                LoginUIView()
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- Scene : protocol Scene acts as a container for a view hierarchy. It's lifecycle is managed by the system.
- WindowGroup: It's a Scene that represents a group of identically structured windows or view hierarchy. It behaves differently on ios, macos and ipados. Each window created form this maintains independent state. 
- Views : Views are placed inside body. ie: var body: some View { //views are placed here }
    - Layout Views: VStack, HStack, ZStack, Lazy V/H Stacks, Spacer, etc.
    - Control Views: Text, Label, Button, TabView, NavigationView/NavigationLink, Label, etc
    - Paints Views: Angular/Linear/Radial Gradient
    - Other Views: Image, Group, Capsule, Container Relative Shape, Empty View, Menu etc.
- Icons : There are many system icons which can be listed/viewed using "SF Symbols" developer app (need to install it from apples's developer website). And can be inserted into views using : Image(systemName: "NameOfTheIcon")Â 

### Background Color:
Background color works with ZStack (depth stack). So everything needs to be inserted into
```swuft
ZStack {
    Color(.lightGray)
        .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
}
```
### Custom Font Integration:
- Download the font file (.ttf) and place into project (make a new group/dir named "fonts" and paste the ttf file) 
- check the forn form launchscreen
- add info.plist (on swiftui & xcode14 it's the info of the target) entry on "Fonts provided by application" category, and add the fontName.ttf in the value param. Multiple fonts can be added there, as the category accept array.
- use font as : View(...).font(Font.custom("Font-Name", size: Int))

### Preview Only the content:
```swift
struct ContactBtn_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContactBtn(sysIcon: "link", infoTexts: "Some Text").previewLayout(.sizeThatFits)
    }
}
// also make the preview area "selectable" form the left bottom panel of the preview area
```
### Navigations:

```swift

@State var goToMain: Bool = false;

var body: some View {
    
    NavigationView {
    
        VStack {

            /**
            * Navigate on state change
            */
                
            NavigationLink(
                destination: MainView(),
                isActive: $goToMain,
                label: {
                    EmptyView()
                }
            )

            /**
            * Click Navigation
            */
                    
            HStack {
                    List {
                        Spacer()
                        Text("Register")
                            .overlay(
                                NavigationLink(
                                    destination: RegisterView()) {
                                    EmptyView();
                                }
                            )
                            .foregroundColor(blue)
                        Spacer()
                    }
            }
                    
        }
    }
    .navigationBarHidden(true)
}
```

### TabView:
```swift
import SwiftUI

struct MainView: View {
    var body: some View {
        TabView(selection: Selection ) {
            DashboardView().tabItem { Label(
                title: { Text("Label") },
                icon: { Image(systemName: "house.circle") })
            }
            ProfileView().tabItem { Label(
                title: { Text("Label") },
                icon: { Image(systemName: "person") })
            }
            SettingsView().tabItem {
                Label(
                    title: { Text("Label") },
                    icon: { Image(systemName: "gear") })
            }
        }
    }
}
```

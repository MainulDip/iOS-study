### Assets and Icons Generator:
https://www.appicon.co is a good place to generate all the Image Sets and icons for both ios and Android.

* To actually add the assets to xcode, it requires to drag the files separately/exclusively into the Assets.xcassets folder within xcode. Otherwise the assets will not be visible inside xcode.

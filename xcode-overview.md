## Xcode Overview:
- Terminal : xcode doesn't have integrated terminal like vs-code or android studio, etc. Separate terminal is what it has.

- Integrated Docs : Unique Feature. All the developer's docs can be found of the "help" section of xcode.

### Major areas:
- Left (cmd 0) | Right | Bottom (Debug Area) (shift + cmd + y)

### Shortcuts:
- Build : cmd + r

### task
- clone view : alt/option drag
- view to IBOutlet Connection : ctrl + drag the arrow

### Code Indentations and beautification:
To refactor the code indentation (beatify/pretty), xcode requires you to select the code block and then editor -> Structure -> Re-indent 

### IBOutlet and IBActions'c Connections UI:
It is at the lat entry of the storyboard's view's attribute panel.
All IB connections are there. Disconnected connections should be removed. Otherwise there will be Error. Always clean the disconnected outlet.
